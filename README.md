My name is Alexis but, you can call me Lex if you'de like. I am currently transitioning into the User Experience Design world, finding new, creative ways to bridge the gap between Technical Support and User Experience. I am looking forward to cultivating the skills I have and will obtain to share with the world my creative spark and ideas.

### :woman_technologist: My Journey
In my wonderful journey from IT support to the world of UX design, I’ve discovered that the key to both is the same—helping people have a smoother, more enjoyable experience with technology. My background as an IT support specialist gave me a front-row seat to all the little things that make users scratch their heads, and now, as a budding UX designer, I'm obsessed with solving those puzzles before they even happen. Whether it's revamping interfaces or gathering feedback from users, I’m diving into the design world headfirst! As someone who’s designed interactive dashboards and reports that boosted user engagement by 25%, I’ve always loved creating systems that not only work but feel intuitive. While working with tools like Power BI and HTML/CSS, I’ve been translating raw data and code into designs that people actually enjoy using. And hey, when you’re designing a dashboard that helps people get what they need faster, you know you're doing something right! Now, I’m blending my techie side with my creative brain, thanks to my front-end development training. It’s been fun putting together responsive websites, conducting usability tests, and learning how to create user experiences that don’t just function but truly shine. My mission? To build digital spaces that are as welcoming as a cozy café, where every click, scroll, and tap feels just right.
